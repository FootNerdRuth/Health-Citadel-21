The Health Citadel

P2P, decentralized health network built on Bitcoin. 

**Health:** The process of taking full responsibility for one's well being. 
**Citadel:** A fortified space where individuals seek safety and gain the ability to defend. 

Tools for defence: Bitcoin, truth, community

We defend our time and we defend our health. Because time is the only scarce resource and health is what makes time valuable. 

**Mission components:**

Create an open source health protocol.
Develop a protocol to validate health nodes.
Design a peer to peer decentralized, online marketplace.
